In this program I used AES in OFB mode to encrypt and decrypt a message. In order to implement this I used the cryptography library.

The program will ask the user to enter a message to encrypt and then it will display the encrypted message and the initialization vector.

Then the program will ask the user to enter the encrypted message and the initialization vector to decrypt the message.

Finally the program will display the decrypted message.
